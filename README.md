# How do I run it?
You need to have npm and python 2.7 installed for this to work. Then, run the following commands to start up the server on `localhost:3000`.
```
git clone https://github.com/luketrenaman/rpimidi.git
cd rpimidi
npm i --python=python2.7
node index.js
```
You can then navigate to `localhost:3000` to view the website, and attach a electric piano via midi cable to enable the realtime features of the website.
